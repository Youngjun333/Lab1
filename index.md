## Young's Personal Page

## Introduction
My name is Young Jun Kim, and I am currently a computer science student at the University of California, San Diego. After taking many courses, my current favorite programming language is **C++** because of how powerful the STL library is at solving data structure problems. Additionally, I simply love the **GDB** debugger because of the various commands that it has for debugging. 

## Algorithms
As someone who is really interested in algorithms, my favorite quote comes from Donald Knuth
> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.

I tend to struggle with understanding an algortihm from solely a mathematical viewpoint, and seeing how the algorithm works really helps me understand it.

My favorite algorithm is how recursive explore works. I find it very interesting how you can recursively traverse a graph with such little lines of code. The algorithm is listed below
```
explore(v) {
    v.visited = true;
    for(v's neighbors) {
        if(neighbor not visited) {
            explore(neighbor);
        }
    }
}
```

## Hobbies

- Video Games
- Hiking
- Fishing
- Competitive Programming (I mainly use [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/))
